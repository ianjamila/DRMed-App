-- 0159_retire_send_out_accrual
--
-- The clinic pays partner labs (Hi Precision, Micromedic…) immediately and
-- records the payment as a "Send Out" expense, which posts to 6420 through
-- CATEGORY_TO_COA. The release bridge ALSO debited 6420 (and credited 2150
-- Accrued send-out) for any send-out service with a unit cost configured, then
-- expected a later "true-up" against a vendor bill — a monthly-invoice workflow
-- the clinic does not have. Left in place, every configured send-out would be
-- expensed twice.
--
-- On prod when this was written (2026-09-24): 1 cogs_send_out_entries row
-- (₱0, no journal entry), 0 true-ups, 0 "Send-out COGS" journal lines — so
-- nothing has been double-counted yet and nothing needs reversing.
--
-- This migration re-creates bridge_test_request_released() exactly as 0140
-- left it (prosrc md5 82baea75bd53c272588c8bd4cc7ad127 verified against prod)
-- minus the send-out block: no 6420/2150 lines, no cogs_send_out_entries
-- insert, no send_out.unit_cost_missing audit row. The cogs_send_out_* tables,
-- the true-up bridge and the services.send_out_unit_cost_php /
-- send_out_vendor_id columns are left in place (history kept; nothing writes
-- them any more). The Outside-Lab Costs / Performance pages are removed in the
-- same PR.
